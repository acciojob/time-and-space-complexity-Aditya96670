	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity, a measure of how an algorithm's execution time scales with input size, is crucial for designing efficient algorithms, and is often expressed using Big O notation. </p>
	<p> <b>Space complexity </b>is essentially a parallel concept to time complexity. If you need to create an array of size n, this will take O(n) space. If you build a two-dimensional array of size n*n, this will need O(n2) space. Space complexity is dependent on several factors.</p>
