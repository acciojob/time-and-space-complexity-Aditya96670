	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time Complexity, a measure of how an algorithm's execution time scales with input size, is crucial for designing efficient algorithms, and is often expressed using Big O notation. </p>
	<p><b>Space complexity,</b> is essentially a parallel concept to time complexity. If you need to create an array of size n, this will take O(n) space.</p>
